# Hello, I'm Daniel Zunarelli

I'm a Data Engineer with a background in Business Administration and a strong passion for transforming data into actionable insights. Currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering, I bring a unique mix of business perspective and technical skills to every project.

My journey into tech began when I realized the strategic power of data during my Business Administration studies. Since then, I've been fully immersed in the world of data engineeringâ€”working with tools like Python, SQL, Spark, and Databricks to solve real-world problems and drive decision-making.

I'm highly motivated by continuous learning and thrive in environments where data is at the core of innovation. I'm now looking to bring my skills to international teams where I can contribute, grow, and help deliver scalable data solutions.

**Data Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, PySpark  
**Big Data Tools & Frameworks:** Apache Spark, Databricks  
**Cloud Platforms:** AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
